## 2024-05-24 - Shared loading state causes confusing UX
**Learning:** Using a single boolean state (`investigating`) for loading actions in a mapped list causes all items in the list to visually reflect the loading state, confusing users about which item is actually being processed.
**Action:** Always use specific IDs (`investigatingId`, `approvingId`) for state management in lists to ensure loading feedback is localized exclusively to the interacted item.
